## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## [2.1.0] - 2025-11-20

### Added
- **Custom Output Directory**: New `--output-dir` flag to specify where output files are saved.
- **Overwrite Mode**: New `--overwrite` flag to disable timestamping and overwrite existing files.
- **Timestamped Filenames**: Output files now include a timestamp by default (e.g., `project_name_20231027_120000.txt`) to prevent accidental data loss.

### Changed
- **Default Output Directory**: Renamed from `output/` to `print_project_outputs/` for better clarity.
- **Default Filename Behavior**: Changed from overwriting `project_name.txt` to creating timestamped files `project_name_TIMESTAMP.txt`.
- **Deprecated**: The `--duplicate` flag is now deprecated as timestamping is the default behavior.

## Migration Guide from 1.0.0 to 2.0.0

### Configuration Changes
- Create `config.ini` file for default settings (see provided template)
- Command line arguments have been expanded and some renamed
- Tree generation is now enabled by default (use `--no-tree` to disable)

### New Capabilities
- Use `--include-files` to force include specific files while scanning normally
- Use `--only-include-files` for focused analysis of specific files only
- Customize tree exclusions separately from file processing exclusions
- Enable console output with `--console` for real-time feedback

### Backward Compatibility
- Basic usage (`python print_project.py`) still works with enhanced defaults
- All core functionality preserved and extended
- Output format enhanced but remains readable
